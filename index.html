                        Wow! This tour made me realize how much I love mountains. 
                        After going on one of these tours, 
                        I can safely say that they are my favorite geographic feature, and my favorite word that starts with M.

                    I never understood why people cared so much about mountains. 
                    But then I went on one of these tours. Now I can't understand people who don't care about mountains!
